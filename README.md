# Gnu Radio Block Implementation for FLEX

Gnu Radio is an open-source development toolkit, capable of simulating real-world radio systems. It is a modular flow-based framework,
in which you piece together predefined functions and operations to develop your own communication system. 

This code provides an implementation of a receive block for the FlexRadio 6K series. It depends upon the flexclient python module, which can be installed with pip.
